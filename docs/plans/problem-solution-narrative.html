    <h2>The Problem</h2>

    <p>In the first half of 2025, the United States experienced 150 politically-motivated attacks—nearly twice as many as the year before. Threats against lawmakers have surged to 14,000 annually. Hate incidents reached the second-highest level since the FBI began tracking them in 1991.</p>

    <p>This violence doesn't emerge from nowhere. It follows a predictable path: misinformation spreads, trust collapses, polarization deepens, and people begin to see their fellow citizens as enemies. Today, only 28% of Americans trust the media—down from 68% in 1972. Nearly three-quarters of partisans view the other side as "immoral." And 87% of Americans say polarization itself is a threat to our country.</p>

    <p>The platforms where most public discourse now happens weren't designed to help us understand each other. They were designed to maximize engagement—and outrage, conflict, and division are engaging. The result: 68% of Americans say social media has impacted their relationships. Friendships have ended. Families have fractured. And increasingly, words have turned to violence.</p>

    <div class="transition">But it doesn't have to be this way.</div>

    <p>The same technology that amplifies division can be designed to foster understanding. The same data that powers outrage algorithms can surface common ground. The problem isn't human nature—it's platform design.</p>

    <h2>The Solution</h2>

    <p>Unlike social media platforms designed for engagement, <strong>ReasonBridge</strong> is designed for understanding.</p>

    <p>ReasonBridge is a platform for rational discourse that uses AI-powered analysis to help people engage productively across differences. Instead of rewarding the loudest or most provocative voices, ReasonBridge rewards good-faith dialogue—helping users identify bias, evaluate evidence, find common ground, and move from conflict toward shared understanding.</p>

    <h3>Grounded in Research</h3>

    <div class="research-grid">
        <div class="research-item">
            <strong>Kahneman</strong> (dual-process theory)
            <span>Prompts reflective thinking over reactive responses</span>
        </div>
        <div class="research-item">
            <strong>Haidt</strong> (Moral Foundations Theory)
            <span>Surfaces shared values beneath disagreements</span>

        </div>
    </div>

    <h3>How It Works</h3>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>AI-assisted analysis</strong> surfaces bias, identifies logical fallacies, and highlights agreement</li>
        <li><strong>Structured discussion</strong> organizes claims so conversations build toward clarity</li>
        <li><strong>Good-faith incentives</strong> reward constructive engagement over inflammatory rhetoric</li>
        <li><strong>Common ground discovery</strong> helps people find shared values amid disagreement</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="mission-box">
        <p>In an era of division and misinformation, ReasonBridge provides tools for rational discourse. Through AI-powered analysis and incentives for good-faith dialogue, we help people turn diverse perspectives into collective wisdom—and better outcomes for everyone.</p>
