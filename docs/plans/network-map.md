## Outreach Prioritization Strategy

### Why Order Matters

1. **Inner circle first** - They'll give honest feedback and help refine your pitch
2. **Strategic advisors second** - Their input shapes your approach before you go wide
3. **Believers third** - Early donations create momentum and social proof
4. **Connectors fourth** - Amplify only after you've refined your message and have traction

### Outreach Phases

| Phase | Who | Goal | Timing |
|-------|-----|------|--------|
| **Phase A** | Inner circle (Kathy, Andy, Julie) | Align on vision, get feedback, recruit to core team | Week 1-2 |
| **Phase B** | Strategic advisors (cousin, Rich) | Legal/strategic guidance, refine approach | Week 2-3 |
| **Phase C** | Believers (friends, FB quitters, colleagues) | Early donations, testimonials, beta users | Week 3-6 |
| **Phase D** | Connectors (Justin, Alex, Ben, communities) | Amplification, introductions, broader reach | Week 6+ |
