## The Problem

In the first half of 2025, the United States experienced 150 politically-motivated attacks—nearly twice as many as the year before. Threats against lawmakers have surged to 14,000 annually. Hate incidents reached the second-highest level since the FBI began tracking them in 1991.

This violence doesn't emerge from nowhere. It follows a predictable path: misinformation spreads, trust collapses, polarization deepens, and people begin to see their fellow citizens as enemies. Today, only 28% of Americans trust the media—down from 68% in 1972. Nearly three-quarters of partisans view the other side as "immoral"—up from less than half in 2016. And 87% of Americans say polarization itself is a threat to our country.

The platforms where most public discourse now happens weren't designed to help us understand each other. They were designed to maximize engagement—and outrage, conflict, and division are engaging. The result: 68% of Americans say social media has impacted their relationships. Friendships have ended. Families have fractured. And increasingly, words have turned to violence.

## But it doesn't have to be this way.

The same technology that amplifies division can be designed to foster understanding. The same data that powers outrage algorithms can surface common ground. The problem isn't human nature—it's platform design.

## The Solution

Unlike social media platforms designed for engagement, **ReasonBridge** is designed for understanding.

ReasonBridge is a platform for rational discourse that uses AI-powered analysis to help people engage productively across differences. Instead of rewarding the loudest or most provocative voices, ReasonBridge rewards good-faith dialogue—helping users identify bias, evaluate evidence, find common ground, and move from conflict toward shared understanding.

### Grounded in Research

ReasonBridge applies proven behavioral science research:

- **Kahneman** (dual-process theory) — prompts reflective thinking over reactive responses
- **Haidt** (Moral Foundations Theory) — surfaces shared values beneath surface disagreements
- **Gross** (emotion regulation) — de-escalates conflict through cognitive reappraisal
- **Fogg** (behavior design) — makes constructive communication the path of least resistance

### How It Works

- **AI-assisted analysis** surfaces bias in arguments, identifies logical fallacies, and highlights where participants actually agree
- **Structured discussion** organizes claims and evidence so conversations build toward clarity, not chaos
- **Good-faith incentives** reward constructive engagement rather than inflammatory rhetoric
- **Common ground discovery** helps people find shared values even amid disagreement

## Our Mission

**In an era of division and misinformation, ReasonBridge provides tools for rational discourse. Through AI-powered analysis and incentives for good-faith dialogue, we help people turn diverse perspectives into collective wisdom—and better outcomes for everyone.**

## The Ask

ReasonBridge is a functional product ready for public launch. We're establishing as a 501(c)(3) non-profit because we believe rational discourse is a public good—not a product to monetize.

We're seeking seed funding to:

- Launch publicly and onboard early users
- Refine our AI analysis tools based on real-world feedback
- Build the foundation for grant funding and long-term sustainability

**Your support helps rebuild the infrastructure of democratic discourse—before more relationships fracture and more words turn to violence.**
