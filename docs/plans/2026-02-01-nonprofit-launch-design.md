# ReasonBridge Non-Profit Organization Launch Plan

**Created**: 2026-02-01
**Status**: Planning
**Author**: Tony (Founder)

---

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a phased strategy to launch ReasonBridge as a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization. The approach prioritizes speed-to-fundraising through fiscal sponsorship while building toward organizational independence and eventual full-time founder transition over 3-5 years.

**Core Philosophy**: Rational discourse is a public good that shouldn't be profit-driven.

---

## Current Situation

| Factor | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Product | Functional MVP, demo-ready |
| Timeline goal | ASAP (months, not years) |
| Available budget | $500-2,000 |
| Network | Unexplored (needs mapping) |
| Location | Ohio |
| Scope (Year 1-2) | Product-focused |
| Available time | 10-20 hours/week alongside full-time job |
| Current compensation | ~$240k/year ($210k salary + $30k bonus) |
| Full-time goal | Phased transition over 3-5 years |

---

## Strategic Approach: Fiscal Sponsorship First

### Why This Approach

Rather than pursuing direct 501(c)(3) incorporation immediately, starting under fiscal sponsorship provides:

1. **Speed**: Accept tax-deductible donations within 2-4 weeks
2. **Low risk**: Validate fundraising ability before investing in legal fees
3. **Mentorship**: Sponsors provide guidance and credibility
4. **Flexibility**: Transition to independence when ready, not before

### Recommended Fiscal Sponsors

| Sponsor | Fee | Fit | Timeline |
|---------|-----|-----|----------|
| **Open Collective Foundation** (recommended) | 10% | Excellent for open-source/civic tech | 1-2 weeks |
| **Hack Club Bank** | 7% | Tech-focused, very fast | Days |
| **Social Good Fund** | 7-9% | Broader non-profit focus | 2-3 weeks |

**Open Collective Foundation** is recommended for:
- Strong alignment with open/civic tech missions
- Transparent public fundraising page built-in
- Easy expense management and reimbursements
- Community of similar projects for visibility

---

## Phase 1: Fiscal Sponsorship Setup (Weeks 1-4)

**Goal**: Get legally able to accept tax-deductible donations

### Week 1-2: Choose and Apply to Fiscal Sponsor

**Application materials needed**:
1. Mission statement (2-3 sentences)
2. Project description (1 page)
3. Budget estimate (rough first-year projections)
4. Your bio/background

### Week 3-4: Setup and Launch

- Complete sponsor onboarding
- Set up public fundraising page
- Connect bank account for reimbursements
- Announce to immediate network (soft launch)

**Cost**: $0 upfront (fees come from donations)
**Time investment**: ~5-10 hours total

---

## Phase 2: Foundation Building (Weeks 3-8)

**Goal**: Prepare materials and relationships needed before actively fundraising

### Network Mapping Exercise (Week 3-4)

Identify 20-50 people in these categories:

1. **Tech colleagues** - Current/former coworkers who care about discourse, democracy, or civic tech
2. **Online communities** - People from Twitter/X, Reddit, Hacker News, Discord servers
3. **Domain experts** - Anyone in journalism, academia, mediation, debate, philosophy
4. **Potential users** - People who've complained about online discourse, polarization, misinformation
5. **Connectors** - People who know lots of people (even if they wouldn't donate themselves)

### Core Materials to Prepare (Week 4-6)

| Material | Purpose | Length |
|----------|---------|--------|
| **Mission statement** | Your north star, used everywhere | 2-3 sentences |
| **Problem/solution narrative** | Why this matters, what you're building | 1 page |
| **Demo video** | Show the MVP in action | 2-3 minutes |
| **One-pager** | Leave-behind for potential supporters | 1 page PDF |
| **Budget & milestones** | What funding enables, concrete goals | 1 page |

### Credibility Building (Week 5-8)

- Write 1-2 blog posts about the problem you're solving
- Share demo with 5-10 people from network map, collect testimonials
- Engage in online communities discussing discourse/polarization (add value, don't pitch)

**Time investment**: ~30-40 hours across 5 weeks (~6-8 hrs/week)

---

## Phase 3: Fundraising Launch (Weeks 8-16)

**Goal**: Raise $10,000-25,000 seed funding to validate model and fund initial development

### Funding Tiers

| Tier | Amount | Benefits | Target |
|------|--------|----------|--------|
| **Supporter** | $25-100 | Updates, name on supporters page | Broad network |
| **Backer** | $250-500 | Above + early access, input on features | Engaged believers |
| **Sponsor** | $1,000-2,500 | Above + quarterly calls, logo placement | Tech professionals |
| **Founding Partner** | $5,000+ | Above + advisory input, founding recognition | High-net-worth individuals, small foundations |

### Launch Sequence

**Week 8 - Soft Launch**
- Share with 20-50 mapped contacts personally
- Individual messages explaining why you're reaching out to them specifically
- Not a mass email

**Week 9 - Public Launch**
- Post on social media, Hacker News, relevant subreddits
- Product Hunt launch for the app itself
- Press outreach to civic tech publications

**Week 10 - Follow-up Wave**
- Thank early supporters publicly
- Share momentum ("We've raised $X from Y supporters!")
- Personal follow-up with warm leads

### Ongoing Fundraising Habits (Weeks 10-16)

- Weekly update to supporters (transparency builds trust)
- One coffee chat per week with someone from network
- Track everything: who you've talked to, what they said, follow-up needed

### Realistic Expectations

- 5-10% conversion from direct asks
- Average individual donation: $50-150
- First $5,000 from 30-50 individual supporters
- Larger donations ($1,000+) come from deeper relationships

**Time investment**: ~10-15 hours/week during active launch, ~5 hours/week maintenance

---

## Phase 4: Growth & Independence (Months 6-18)

**Goal**: Build sustainability and transition to independent 501(c)(3)

### Transition Triggers

Pursue 501(c)(3) independence when you hit 2-3 of these:

- [ ] Raised $25,000+ total
- [ ] Have 3+ recurring monthly donors or sponsors
- [ ] App launched publicly with active users
- [ ] Built a small board (3-5 committed advisors)
- [ ] Clear 12-month runway or funding pipeline

### Building Your Board (Months 6-12)

A 501(c)(3) requires minimum 3 board members in Ohio.

| Role | Look For | Why |
|------|----------|-----|
| **Technical advisor** | Engineer who believes in the mission | Product credibility, technical guidance |
| **Non-profit veteran** | Someone who's run/served on non-profit boards | Governance, compliance, connections |
| **Domain expert** | Journalist, mediator, academic | Mission credibility, partnerships |

Build relationships before asking anyone to join.

### Grant Readiness (Months 9-15)

**Target foundations for civic tech/democracy work**:
- Knight Foundation
- Mozilla Foundation
- Craig Newmark Philanthropies
- Democracy Fund
- Local community foundations (Ohio)

**Preparation**:
- Document impact (users, testimonials, outcomes)
- Build relationships with program officers before applying
- Start with smaller grants ($5,000-15,000) to build track record

### 501(c)(3) Filing Process (Months 12-18)

1. **Incorporate in Ohio** (~$99, 1-2 weeks)
2. **File IRS Form 1023 or 1023-EZ** ($275-600 fee, 1-6 months approval)
3. **Register with Ohio Attorney General** (required for soliciting donations)
4. **Set up proper bookkeeping** (QuickBooks Non-Profit or Wave)

**Total cost**: ~$1,000-1,500
**Timeline**: 3-6 months from start to finish

## Phased Transition to Full-Time

### Current Compensation Baseline

### The Transition Ladder

| **D** | Full-time ReasonBridge | $275k+ annual budget | $200-240k from non-profit |

### Transition Triggers (Proof Points, Not Time)

| Transition | Only When You Have |
|------------|-------------------|
| A → B | $50k+ secured for next 12 months, board in place, product launched |
| B → C | $125k+ secured, major grant ($50k+) confirmed, clear path to more |
| C → D | $275k+ annual budget, 18+ months runway, multiple funding sources |

### Funding Sources at Scale

| Individual donors | $25,000-50,000 | Sustaining base, recurring monthly |

### Financial Safety Net Requirements

Before any transition:
- 6-12 months personal expenses saved (separate from non-profit)
- Health insurance plan secured (COBRA, ACA, or spouse's plan)
- Spouse/partner alignment on the risk

### Pre-Transition Questions to Explore

1. Does employer offer reduced schedule options (80% / 4 days)?
2. Sabbatical or leave options available?
3. Moonlighting policy restrictions?
4. Remote/async flexibility already in place?
