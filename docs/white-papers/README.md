# ReasonBridge Defensive Publications

To protect our innovations from patent trolling and support the open civic technology ecosystem, we've published white papers documenting our key technical approaches. These publications establish **prior art**, preventing others from patenting these approaches.

## Published Papers

### 1. Polarization Measurement and Multi-Axis Common Ground Synthesis for Online Deliberation

**Status:** Draft complete, pending arXiv submission

**Abstract:** We present a novel computational framework for distinguishing genuine polarization from misunderstanding using a Gini impurity-based polarization metric combined with a tri-modal common ground taxonomy. Our approach classifies discussion points into agreement zones (≥70% consensus), misunderstandings (≥30% nuanced responses), and genuine disagreements (balanced opposition with low nuance).

**Key Innovations:**

- First application of Gini impurity to viewpoint polarization
- Nuance as diagnostic signal for semantic confusion vs. value-based conflict
- Tri-modal taxonomy (agreement/misunderstanding/disagreement)
- Consensus scoring normalization for cross-context comparison

**Files:**

- [Full Paper (Markdown)](01-polarization-common-ground/paper.md)
- [Code References](01-polarization-common-ground/code-references.md)

**arXiv ID:** _Pending submission_

### 2. Moral Foundations Theory Operationalization for Cross-Ideological Bridge-Building (Planned)

**Status:** Planned for Week 2

**Coverage:**

- Moral Foundations Theory integration
- Argument translation across moral foundations
- Bridging suggestion with consensus confidence
- Fallacy pattern recognition taxonomy

---

### 3. Pattern-Based Bot Detection and Trust Scoring for Civic Discourse (Planned)

**Status:** Planned for Week 3

**Coverage:**

- Multi-factor bot detection without ML
- Mayer's ABI trust model implementation
- Hierarchical proposition clustering
- Optimistic locking for concurrent editing

## Why Defensive Publications?

### Patent Trolling Prevention

Patent trolls acquire broad patents on common software techniques and sue implementers for licensing fees. By publishing detailed technical descriptions, we establish **prior art** that:

1. Makes these techniques **unpatentable** (novelty destroyed)
2. Creates a **searchable record** for patent examiners
3. Protects the **civic tech ecosystem** from predatory litigation

### Open Access Mission

These publications align with ReasonBridge's nonprofit mission:

- **Transparency** - Full disclosure of our technical approaches
- **Reproducibility** - Detailed implementations for other civic tech projects
- **Community Benefit** - Free access to research and code

### Legal Strategy

Defensive publications are a recognized IP strategy used by:

- **IBM** - Publishes 500+ defensive disclosures annually via Technical Disclosure Commons
- **Google** - Uses defensive publication to protect Android ecosystem
- **Linux Foundation** - Protects open-source implementations through prior art databases

## Publication Strategy

### Primary: arXiv.org

- **Timestamped prior art** (legally defensible publication date)
- **Indexed by Google Scholar** (discoverable by patent examiners)
- **No peer review delay** (immediate publication within 1-2 business days)
- **Free** (no publication fees)
- **Permanent** (archived by Cornell University Library)

**Categories:**

- `cs.HC` (Human-Computer Interaction)
- `cs.CY` (Computers and Society)

### Secondary: GitHub Pages

- **Accessible** - Markdown format for easy reading
- **Version controlled** - Full history via Git
- **Integrated** - Links from repository README

## Prior Art Search

Before publishing each paper, we conduct a comprehensive prior art search:

1. **Google Scholar** - Search key terms for academic literature
2. **USPTO Patent Search** - Check granted patents and applications
3. **GitHub Code Search** - Verify no similar open-source implementations
4. **arXiv** - Search for similar preprints

**Threshold:** If ≥3 highly similar prior works found, we narrow novelty claims or reconsider publication.
