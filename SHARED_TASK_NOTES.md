- Filter by status (SEEDING/ACTIVE/ARCHIVED), creatorId, tag (name/slug search)
- Pagination support (page, limit)
- Sorting by createdAt, participantCount, responseCount with asc/desc order
- DTOs for query validation and paginated response formatting

## Next Steps
Run `npm run next-issue` to claim and implement the next highest priority issue.

## Notes
- pnpm is now installed globally and should be used for workspace operations
- The `status: in-progress` label was created for issue tracking
- All PRs are being squash-merged to main
- Local npm registry (Verdaccio) is running at localhost:4873

## Workflow
1. `npm run next-issue` - claims highest priority issue
2. Create feature branch from main
3. Implement, commit, push
4. Create PR via `gh pr create`
5. Merge via `gh pr merge --squash`
6. Pull main, repeat
